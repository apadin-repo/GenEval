# Summary of "Secure AI Framework Approach" by Google

---

### **Purpose**

The document provides a practical guide for implementing Google's **Secure AI Framework (SAIF)**. SAIF is designed to help organizations secure AI systems, address AI-specific risks, and adapt traditional cybersecurity practices to the AI context.

---

### **Key Implementation Steps**

1. **Understand the Use**

   * Identify the AI application and business context.
   * Evaluate risks based on data sensitivity, deployment (internal vs. external), and development approach (custom vs. third-party).

2. **Assemble the Team**

   * Include cross-functional stakeholders: business owners, security, engineering, privacy, legal, data science, and ethics teams.

3. **Level Set with an AI Primer**

   * Educate involved parties on AI basics (e.g., ML, LLMs, Gen AI) to align on terminology and concepts.

4. **Apply the Six Core Elements of SAIF**

   * These are flexible components rather than sequential steps:

### **The Six Core Elements**

1. **Expand Strong Security Foundations**

   * Adapt existing controls to AI-specific contexts (e.g., data governance, supply chain tracking).
   * Ensure secure lifecycle management for data and models.
   * Retain and retrain cybersecurity talent to adapt to AI needs.

2. **Extend Detection and Response**

   * Prepare for threats from both AI misuse and AI outputs.
   * Implement content safety policies for Gen AI.
   * Adapt incident response plans for AI-specific risks (e.g., hallucinations, bias).

3. **Automate Defenses**

   * Use AI to improve detection, reduce manual effort, and respond faster.
   * Keep human oversight in critical decision-making loops.

4. **Harmonize Platform-Level Controls**

   * Standardize tools and frameworks to avoid fragmented security practices.
   * Review AI model lifecycles and usage regularly to ensure consistent controls.

5. **Adapt Controls and Create Feedback Loops**

   * Conduct Red Team exercises targeting AI systems.
   * Stay current with novel attacks (e.g., prompt injection, data poisoning).
   * Establish learning loops from incidents to improve protections.

6. **Contextualize AI Risks in Business Processes**

   * Develop a risk framework specific to AI models.
   * Maintain an AI inventory and evaluate third-party model risks.
   * Align security, privacy, and compliance efforts throughout the AI lifecycle.

### **Conclusion**

SAIF aims to provide a security-first approach to AI, balancing innovation and risk. Google encourages organizations to adopt this framework to build secure, scalable, and responsible AI systems.
